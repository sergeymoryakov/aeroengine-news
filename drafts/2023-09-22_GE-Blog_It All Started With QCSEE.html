            The dawn of the jet age gave birth to the concept of the global
            village. Once jet engines made the jump from military fighters to
            civilian planes in the 1950s, commercial passenger service could
            carry people farther and faster than ever before. Fares dropped,
            ticket sales quadrupled, and by 1972 almost half of all Americans
            had traveled by air. But more people flying also meant more
            complications. To reduce runway congestion and noise, industry
            leaders envisioned a fleet of quiet short-haul jets that could take
            off and land using small airfields in less densely populated areas,
            freeing the major terminals for cross-country and intercontinental
            flights. In 1974, NASA awarded GE a contract to design and test an
            engine that could meet the demands of the growing segment of
            short-haul traffic. What resulted was a suite of groundbreaking
            technologies — some soon pressed into production, others far ahead
            of their time — in the form of the Quiet Clean Short-Haul
            Experimental Engine (QCSEE). One of GE’s first commercial technology
            demonstration programs, QCSEE affirmed the promise of more
            fuel-efficient flight. As part of the contract, GE built two
            experimental engines — an over-the-wing unit and an under-the-wing
            variant. Now GE is taking the QCSEE out of storage and putting it on
            display. Starting September 21, visitors to the GE Aerospace
            Learning Centre in Evendale, Ohio, can see the engine that,
            according to Chief Engineer Chris Lorence, “provided the basis for
            our commercial product portfolio as we know it today.” The ribbon

            intended for commercial production, demonstration engines give
            designers the freedom to take risks and explore ideas. With QCSEE,
            GE engineers seized the opportunity to be bold. In an effort to
            dampen noise, they overhauled the prevailing jet engine design and
            ended up confirming that many of the characteristics that make an
            engine quiet also make it efficient. “An aircraft engine can
            generate thrust either by accelerating a little bit of air by a lot,
            or by accelerating a lot of air by a little,” explains David
            Ostdiek, a lead engineer on GE’s latest demonstrator, the RISE
            program, which is being developed by CFM International, a 50-50
            joint company between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines. Turbojet
            engines, common on midcentury airliners, adopt the former strategy:
            Most of the air that enters the engine flows through the core, where
            it is pressurized, mixed with fuel, and ignited. It then shoots out
            as a narrow stream of ultra-fast exhaust, propelling the plane
            forward. The Quiet Clean Short-Haul Experimental Engine developed by
            GE and NASA in 1978. Turbojets made possible the fast flight speeds
            of the early jet age, but they also guzzled fuel, and their
            high-velocity exhaust produced most of the noise associated with
            these aircraft. For a quieter engine, the QCSEE engineers revisited
            a concept GE had implemented a handful of times in the 1950s and
            ’60s: the turbofan. Based on the second method of producing thrust —
            accelerating a large mass of air by a little — turbofan engines
            channel most of the airflow around the core rather than through it.
            Driven by the fan, this air also creates thrust when it exits out
            the back of the engine. The ratio of the masses of each stream — the
            air that skirts around the core and the air that passes through it —
            is called the bypass ratio. Thanks to slower total exhaust flow,
            engines with higher bypass ratios are quieter. They’re also more
            efficient, because when less air moves through the core, less fuel
            burns. The QCSEE engines, which incorporated a gearbox to help slow
            down the fan speed, had an unprecedented bypass ratio in the range
            of 11:1, meaning that for every unit of air that passed through the
            combustion chamber, 11 units bypassed the combustion process. “QCSEE
            helped prove to the world that we could advance high bypass ratios
            to get more efficient engines,” Lorence says. “All commercial
            engines today are going to higher and higher bypass ratios.” GE
            applied the lessons from QCSEE to develop a succession of more
            efficient high-bypass commercial engines, including the CFM56 (under
            CFM International), the GE90, the GEnx, and the CFM LEAP. [Continued
            after sidebar] —————————————————————————————————————— Five Key
            Technologies Advanced by QCSEE The technologies GE developed for
            QCSEE laid the groundwork for the next 50 years of engine designs.
            Here are five lessons from the program that are still guiding
            innovation. Low-pressure, high-bypass fans. Directing more air
            around the engine core, rather than through it, leads to huge fuel
            savings. Composites. Lightweight polymer components used in the fan
            blades, frame, and outer case reduce weight. Variable pitch. When
            the engine’s fan blades rotate as well as spin, the pilot can
            balance lift and thrust at different speeds. FADEC/digital control.
            Electronic controls help pilots manage increasingly versatile engine
            systems. Acoustic treatments. High-bypass engines are inherently
            quieter than alternatives in the same thrust class. Perforated inner
            and outer walls, sound-absorbing panels, and slower-moving fan
            blades also help dampen engine noise.
            —————————————————————————————————————— Of course, pushing a larger
            mass of air requires a wider fan, as well as a thicker hub and a
            bigger case to contain them both. If made of metal, these components
            would weigh the plane down. So the engineers tested lighter graphite
            and Kevlar components for the fan blades, frame, and outer case, and
            a graphite-polymer resin for the fan’s inner duct. “These composite
            materials were the key enabler for high efficiency,” Ostdiek says.
            Some 20 years later, the GE90 became the first commercial jet engine
            to be certified with composite fan blades; composite materials also
            helped boost the GEnx’s fuel efficiency by up to 15% over that of
            its predecessor, the CF6. To cut yet more weight, the QCSEE team
            pioneered the use of variable-pitch fan blades. In the
            under-the-wing model, each blade could pirouette within its slot in
            the hub to face incoming air at different angles, allowing the pilot
            to optimize the balance between lift and thrust as airspeed changed.
            The blades could even rotate 180 degrees to blow air out the front
            of the engine, eliminating the need for a conventional thrust
            reversal system to assist with braking after landing. Although the
            technology has not yet been used in a production model, variable
            pitch is a key component of the RISE program’s open fan
            architecture. To help the pilot manage the intertwined variables of
            blade pitch, fan speed, and thrust, the QCSEE team replaced
            traditional hydraulic levers with a digital control system that
            maintained operation within safe limits. A few years later, GE
            introduced digital controllers in its commercial engines; the
            company’s most recent generation of products — the Passport, GEnx,
            CFM LEAP, and GE9X engines — have full-authority digital engine
            controls, or FADEC. “In any modern engine, electronics control every
            system,” Lorence says. “That all started with what we demonstrated
            in QCSEE.” Composite fan blades first tested with the QCSEE program
            in the 1970s were further developed and introduced into service with
            the GE90 commercial aircraft engine. The QCSEE program ended in
            1978, but its innovations have lived on in nearly five decades of GE
            engines. The company sees the RISE program following in its
            footsteps, spawning the next generation of more sustainable
            technology. “RISE is the culmination of everything we demonstrated
            in QCSEE — high bypass facilitated by a gearbox, composite fan
            blades, digital electronic controls, variable pitch — plus all that
            we’ve learned since then,” Lorence says. “That’s why it’s going to
            be an industry leader in efficiency.” At a company that has achieved
            a lot of firsts, QCSEE may have slipped under the radar, forgotten
            as a string of ever more advanced engines came to market. But in the
            Learning Centre, it’s going to finally get the attention it
            deserves. “While we think about how we’re going to invent the
            future,” Lorence says, “this is an opportunity to show appreciation
            for the heritage that got us to where we are today.”
