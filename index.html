                    <h4>Shop Visit Activity</h4>

                    <p>
                        As global passenger traffic continues to grow this year,
                        engine shop visits are expected to further ascend, with
                        a higher volume of extensive work scopes anticipated.
                        Aviation Week’s Commercial Fleet &amp; MRO Forecast 2023
                        data projects approximately 7,686 engine overhauls this
                        year. That figure is expected to climb further in 2024
                        and 2025, to 8,837 and 8,995 shop visits, respectively.
                        In 2023, the same data set values the engine MRO segment
                        at $39.3 billion, accounting for 45% of the whole
                        commercial aftermarket. Engine slot availability remains
                        competitive in North America and Europe.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The return of China’s MRO market has been a boon for MRO
                        providers in the Asia-Pacific region but has inevitably
                        led to fresh concerns about near-term capacity, although
                        several long-term joint ventures are planned to rectify
                        this. Despite engine MROs looking to add capacity to
                        meet surging demand in certain regions, overall global
                        shop visits remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. The
                        industry consensus is that the engine segment will most
                        likely return to pre-COVID levels in the second half of
                        2024.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Engine Supply Chain Issues Could Be Long-Term</h4>

                    <p style="">
                        Reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to
                        OEM production constraints. MRO shops have seen engine
                        lead times grow considerably, particularly on
                        new-generation asset types in short supply owing to
                        technical underperformance, sluggish production rates
                        and shortages in areas such as labor. The Russia-Ukraine
                        war has also created shortfalls in raw materials such as
                        steel and titanium that have contributed to the problem.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The rise in shop visit volumes in a segment still
                        playing postpandemic catch-up is putting further stress
                        on the challenged engine MRO supply chain in areas such
                        as parts repair volumes. “Customers are sending more
                        parts out for repair than previously when there were
                        fewer constraints on the supply chain,” says Mike Walsh,
                        president of U.S.-based BP Aero. He attributes this
                        rising demand to several factors, including increasing
                        worldwide shop visits, delays in the supply chain
                        related to slow new parts deliveries from OEMs, MROs
                        reaching capacity and longer lead times at repair shops.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With capacity at a premium, more operators are looking
                        at alternative repair routes away from overhauls and
                        constrained parts markets in the short-to-medium term.
                        Demand for quick-turn and hospital shop services, a
                        popular capability addition in recent years for
                        non-engine specialist MROs, remains robust. Alternatives
                        such as parts manufacturer approval (PMA) parts sourcing
                        and tapping into designated engineering representative
                        (DER) repairs, of which companies are looking to extend
                        the threshold, have also become more attractive. “DER
                        repairs are the necessary evil that we have to deal with
                        until the supply chain and capacity get back to a
                        manageable level,” Anthony Spaulding, president and CEO
                        of Magellan Aviation Group, said in June at Aviation
                        Week’s Engine Leasing, Trading &amp; Finance conference
                        in London.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Remedying Labor Shortages</h4>

                    <p>
                        Airframe manufacturers are looking to rectify the
                        problem by increasing production targets. In turn,
                        engine-makers are addressing capacity concerns through
                        adding engine shop capacity and rebuilding the
                        workforce, which took a substantial hit during the
                        pandemic. At the Paris Air Show in June, CFM
                        International revealed plans to expand its Leap engine
                        support presence to 20 shops by adding Leap Open MRO
                        Network partners.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        GE Aerospace expects to hire around 2,000 people this
                        year, while Pratt &amp; Whitney tells
                        <i>Inside MRO</i> it aims to add some 700 new staff to
                        its aftermarket business by year-end after hiring more
                        than 1,400 employees globally last year.

                        The loss of skilled workers over the past few years has
                        left a void of talent and experience—one that is

                        a problem last year, but this year it’s even more
                        serious because the manpower shortages are still there,
                        but we now see this in the material shortages,” Fulya
                        Turkoz, head of sales for engine services for Europe,
                        Middle East and Africa at Lufthansa Technik, said in
                        June at Aviation Week’s MRO BEER conference in Warsaw,
                        Poland.

                        Turkoz explained that, especially when trying to recruit
                        younger people, the German MRO provider increasingly
                        considers what it can do to be more appealing while
                        operating in a very traditional industry. “It’s not just
                        about the salary, but giving the freedom and making the
                        working space much more attractive as an industry,” she
                        said.

                        While hiring the right amount of labor is seen as
                        critical to long-term recovery in the supply chain,
                        there is optimism that turnaround times (TAT) in the
                        engine segment are starting to recover. A representative
                        from Switzerland-based MRO SR Technics sees the supply
                        chain issues and longer TATs resolving in the next 6-12
                        months, depending on the availability of raw materials
                        and specialized workers.

                        Meanwhile, Singapore-based ST Engineering is noting
                        improvements in the supply chain compared to 2022 but
                        still sees challenges. “Some OEMs and parts suppliers
                        are still struggling to meet the demands and TAT for
                        repair and overhaul work, and we continue working
                        closely with them to mitigate such challenges,” says Tan
                        Eng Shu, the company’s executive vice president and head
                        of aerospace MRO.

                    <h4>Engine Cost Considerations</h4>

                    <p>
                        Double-digit inflation in some regions has had an
                        inevitable knock-on effect on engine-related costs. Some
                        engine MROs have reported inflation this year of 11-30%.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At MRO BEER, Alan Downey, vice president for customer
                        technical support at lessor Willis Lease Finance Corp.,
                        which has 330 engines in its lease pool, said returning
                        demand has driven inflationary costs on the MRO side.
                        “It means that the number of spares that are available
                        at any given time has been reduced, and the TAT in the
                        shops has increased,” he explained. However, Downey does
                        not see this as a wholly negative situation. “It’s
                        typical that we would see inflation in some ways as
                        being a good thing and that it’s showing that our very
                        cyclic industry is now on the upside,” he noted. “This
                        is a good thing in general, even if we are seeing that
                        it has a huge impact on our costs of maintenance.”

                    <p>
                        New ways for MROs and airlines to work together have
                        evolved as previous strategies of buying material with
                        the expectation that supply chain impacts would be
                        short-lived have not panned out. For instance, a
                        previous strategy of airlines and MROs buying materials
                        directly from OEMs is not proving as cost-effective as
                        before. This has led to a spike in demand for used
                        serviceable materials while engine part-outs aimed at
                        feeding market stock have increased demand for specific
                        assets.

                    <p>
                        “Something we have noticed recently that is definitely a
                        win-win scenario is when airlines working with MROs open
                        up their books with shop visit planning so that they can
                        work together and do some strategic purchasing in order
                        to take on all these [supply chain] issues,” says
                        Alistair Dibisceglia, director at Oliver Wyman CAVOK.

                    <h4>SAF Focus Expected To Grow</h4>

                    <p>
                        Sustainability is a key driver of technology in the
                        engine segment as the industry strives toward net-zero
                        emissions targets by 2050. In the aftermarket, this has
                        been achieved in the near term by cutting down on waste
                        as MROs switch to paperless operations. The utilization
                        of remote, virtual engine borescope inspections has also
                        picked up speed since COVID-19 as working remotely
                        becomes more widespread.

                    <p>
                        Several high-profile sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)
                        engine projects involving OEMs, MROs and airlines have
                        emerged in recent years. Industry consensus is that SAF
                        is in its infancy both in terms of development and
                        commercial use, while long-term concerns exist in some
                        quarters about the supply of fuel feedstock.

                    <p>
                        Rolls-Royce is among the engine manufacturers developing
                        SAF blends for use in powerplants, having undertaken a
                        series of tests across its business units over the past
                        few years. “By the end of this year, we’d have
                        demonstrated that all of our Trent engines are fully
                        capable of flying on SAF,” said Iain Dudley, head of
                        marketing for Trent XWB engines at Rolls-Royce, speaking
                        about emerging technologies at MRO BEER. He predicts
                        zero emissions as the next step for Rolls, followed by
                        zero-emissions flight through the use of hybrid,
                        electric and hydrogen propulsion.
