            <p>
                As engine overhaul and performance restoration work gradually
                picks up pace in 2023, MRO providers are seeing a steady flow of
                shop visits. Many of these are related to current-generation
                engine types, with CFM International’s CFM56 and International
                Aero Engines’ V2500 accounting for most of the engine
                maintenance activity in the narrowbody segment, according to
                Aviation Week’s Fleet &amp; MRO Forecast data. In the widebody
                engine segment, Rolls-Royce’s Trent 700 series, GE Aerospace’s
                CF6-80, CF34 and GE90 and Pratt &amp; Whitney’s PW4000 are
                anticipated to generate most of the engine shop visit activity
                over the next few years.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the near and midterm, much of the capability ramp-ups have
                centered on narrowbody engine types. A good deal of this
                activity in the next few years likely will revolve around CFM
                International’s Leap program and Pratt &amp; Whitney’s geared
                turbofan (GTF) family. The first wave of Leap and GTF engines
                making their first shop visits is expected to hit in 2025.
                Aviation Week data projects that the Leap 1A, which powers the
                Airbus A320neo and entered service in 2016, will have 80 engine
                overhauls in 2025, nearly double the 48 forecast for 2024. Leap
                1A overhauls are expected to hit three figures starting in 2026
                and continue to ascend. The Leap 1B is not anticipated to see
                any sizable overhaul activity until 2029. Pratt’s PW1100G
                variant, a A320neo option, probably will experience more
                immediate levels of overhaul activity than the Leap. Aviation
                Week data projects that more than 100 PW1100G overhauls will
                take place in 2024, an increase from the 64 expected this year.
            </p>

            <p style="">
                After the segment’s slump in 2020-21, growing demand levels are
                welcome to MRO providers, but the caveat is the need to ensure
                the supply of maintenance services. This issue is proving
                challenging, with concerns around capacity readiness for the
                upsurge in work and labor shortages following global industry
                downsizing due to the COVID-19 pandemic over the past three
                years. In addition, ongoing production issues at engine OEMs
                have created shortages related to components while the pipeline
                of used serviceable material has been constrained on certain
                aircraft and engine types.
            </p>

            <p>
                Engine manufacturers have looked to remedy these issues by
                adding much-needed capacity and capability to their networks.
            </p>

            <p>
                CFM announced several additions to its Leap aftermarket network
                in the past year, with MRO providers in North America, Europe
                and the Asia-Pacific region ready to pick up the eventual
                increase in shop visits. These include Switzerland-based SR
                Technics, which signed a licensing agreement for the Leap 1B in
                February, having joined International Aero Engine’s global
                aftermarket network for the GTF engine last year. The MRO
                provider is one of several companies adding testing capability.
                SR Technics told Aviation Week that it plans to reactivate a
                former test cell in Zurich to prepare for current-generation
                CFM56-5B and -7B engines, the newer PW1100-JM and, eventually,
                for the Leap 1A and 1B.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                Singapore-based ST Engineering also has ramped up its Leap
                capability. Tay Eng Guan, the MRO provider’s senior vice
                president and general manager, says the company plans to grow
                full maintenance capabilities, including testing for the Leap 1A
                and 1B. “We will have test capability for Leap 1B by the end of
                2023 and will be able to carry out full performance restoration
                shop visits by the first quarter of 2025,” he says. “For the
                Leap 1A, we will have test capability by [the first quarter of]
                2024 and full performance restoration shop visit capability by
                the end of 2024.”
            </p>

            <p>
                In the U.S., StandardAero announced plans to start Leap services
                at its facility in San Antonio following the signing of a
                branded service agreement to join CFM International’s
                aftermarket network for Leap 1A and 1B engine services in
                February 2023. “Following 12 months of that going into 2025, we
                plan to move into full performance restoration work on the
                Leap,” Lewis Prebble, president of airlines and fleets at
                StandardAero, tells <i>Inside MRO</i>. “The plan is to start
                services on the 1A and 1B very close together—likely within
                about two months of each other. We’ll determine which one we are
                going to prioritize, but as it stands, the Leap 1B services will
                likely start first.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Large players Lufthansa Technik (LHT) and AFI KLM E&amp;M also
                have rounded out their Leap and GTF capabilities. The German MRO
                giant, which initially partnered on the Leap program in 2018,
                signed a Leap 1B branded service agreement last year, while its
                Franco-Dutch competitor signed a similar agreement for both 1A
                and 1B engines. LHT penned an agreement with Safran Nacelles to
                join the licensed repair network for nacelles on Airbus
                A320neo’s Leap 1A engine in April as well. The agreement enables
                LHT to carry out warranty tasks, repairs and modifications on
                behalf of Safran Nacelles, the specialist repair division of the
                French OEM.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                Meanwhile, MTU Maintenance bolstered its GTF capability last
                year by adding approval for the PW1500G and PW1900G, which power
                the Airbus A220 and Embraer E-Jet, respectively. Iberia
                Maintenance also will start servicing PW1100G engines this year,
                following its addition of GTF test cell capabilities in Madrid.
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially, work related to the Leap and GTF mostly will be
                quick-turn and hospital shop visits, a repair service that saw a
                considerable upsurge in demand during the pandemic and led some
                MRO providers to introduce specific capabilities for these
                lighter engine services. Among these companies was
                Singapore-based SIA Engineering Co., which established a
                specialist quick-turn engine facility for the Leap 1A and 1B
                last year, enabling it to perform 60 engine quick turns per year
                while gaining an estimated 50% capacity boost.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                MROs smaller in scale also have looked to add specific engine
                capabilities such as borescope inspections to capitalize on
                growing demand for lighter, less intensive engine services
                favored by operators since the pandemic.
            </p>

            <p>
                The previously suppressed widebody engine MRO segment has seen
                an unanticipated uptick over the past year. New-generation
                engines such as the GEnx and the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 and XWB
                likely will generate consistent annual overhaul work in the next
                decade.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                Rolls-Royce and GE Aerospace, which dominate the widebody engine
                market, have added several partners to their aftermarket
                networks while establishing joint ventures with new-generation
                engine focuses. Last year, Rolls announced the establishment of
                a China-based joint venture with Air China that will provide MRO
                support for the Trent 700 powering the Airbus A330, Trent XWB-84
                powering the Airbus A350 and the Trent 1000 powering Boeing 787
                aircraft.&nbsp;
