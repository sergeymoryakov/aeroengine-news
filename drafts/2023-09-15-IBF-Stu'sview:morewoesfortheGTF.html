            stuart.hatcher@iba.aero Stu's view: more woes for the GTF This week
            saw the sudden announcement by RTX to upgrade its earlier statement
            to inspect 1,200 GTF engines to rectify metal powder contamination
            that could lead to the cracking of HPT disks to include up to 3,000
            engines. Already last month, the FAA issued a mandate to inspect the
            first and second stage high-pressure turbine disks of certain
            engines within 30 days. With the new announcement, RTX estimates
            that an additional 600-700 engines will require a lengthy visit to
            the shop over and above those already scheduled for shop visits
            between 2023 and 2026. The scary part is that the initial estimate
            of 60 days has been shifted up to 300 days! As a result, RTX expect
            there to be a high number of grounded aircraft from now until the
            end of the first half of next year. This comes as a significant blow
            to both Pratt & Whitney and operators who have already been
            experiencing reliability issues on top of supply chain problems.
            Both Wizz and Lufthansa have voiced their reaction to the situation
            by announcing capacity reductions and the higher use of existing
            ceos. RTX have consequently estimated the profit impact for
            themselves at $3-3.5bn whilst their program partners will face a
            similar impact over the next three years. What I find surprising is
            that both RTX and Airbus continue to remain firm on the ramp-up
            plan. We’ve already seen problems with the provisions of spare
            engines to support the current AOG situation to maintain new
            deliveries, but surely if we end up with the situation whereby circa
            650 aircraft ended up grounded for an extended period, the pressure
            to take engines from the line to support the in-service fleet will
            reach epic proportions. That also assumes that the problem remains
            limited to what they have announced so far. RTX remain firm that
            sales are not expected to be impacted which I feel is optimistic
            given operators have a choice, although it’s not as if CFM have any
            short-term gaps in production this side of 2030. On the positive
            side, the already high demand for serviceable narrowbody aircraft
            will take a further jump. This will speed up the re-entry into
            service where possible of the remaining 250 A319/A320/A321s in
            storage that were parked up between 2020-2022, which ignore those
            that have been in storage for over 3 years, those already in between
            leases, and those stuck in Russia. Well, at least for a few more
            years anyway. Any short-term thoughts of retirements could certainly
            go out of the window for the time being as lease rates shift
            upwards. Part-outs, as already covered in previous weeks, remain at
            an industry low point since the peak in 2013. That said, the A320ceo
            family peaked in 2021 and makes up the bulk of the current part-out
            activity for narrowbodies. Whilst I was forecasting a resurgence of
            A320 part-out activity from 2025 onwards to coincide with production
            ramp-ups and the rectification of known issues, it may need to be
            pushed further out. The economics of what drives a part-out versus
            maintaining its serviceability for a few years more will certainly
            be tested.
