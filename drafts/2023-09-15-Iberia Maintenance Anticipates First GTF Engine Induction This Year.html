            MADRID—Iberia Maintenance expects to induct its first Pratt &
            Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine later this year, in either
            October or November, at its engine shop in Madrid. Speaking to
            Aviation Week at the Aero Engines Europe conference in Madrid this
            week, Enrique Robledo, CTO at Iberia Maintenance, says the MRO
            provider expects the first engines to arrive at its engine shop in
            the next few months. “We’ve recently finished the correlation of the
            test cell, so we now have the tooling and the training in place and
            are expecting the first engine in either October or November,” he
            says. “There is a high demand for this type of engine, and we are
            receiving calls to commence work as soon as possible.” Iberia gained
            certification for the PW1100G, powering Airbus A320neo aircraft,
            nearly a year ago in October 2022. The GTF approval adds to existing
            capabilities in Madrid for the V2500, CFM56 and RB211 engines. For
            nearly three years, Iberia has been ramping up its readiness for the
            engine family by investing in areas such as grinding, balancing and
            test data acquisition. This year, Iberia brought around 150
            mechanics into its engine business in order to meet the ramp-up of
            work. “It is a new engine, and we are building a separate workflow
            for this engine than the rest,” Robledo says. “We have determined
            capacity isolated from the rest of the shop so the capacity of the
            GTF won’t influence the rest of the shop.” Robledo envisages after
            beginning repairs at a fixed level of capacity, Iberia Maintenance
            will eventually grow that capacity year by year or potentially every
            six months. “As a new engine, it makes sense to do it this way and
            will ensure slots are freed up for the rest of the non-GTF engine
            fleet,” he adds. About 27% of Iberia’s overall MRO work is generated
            from the International Airlines Group, the parent company of airline
            affiliate Iberia, which also has British Airways, Aer Lingus and
            Vueling under its banner. The remaining 73% is from third-party
            customers, and over time, Robledo foresees a push for more
            third-party maintenance customers partly driven by engine MRO
            work—and eventually the split will be close to 80% third-party
            customers overall. An interview with Enrique Robledo will feature in
            the October issue of Inside MRO.
