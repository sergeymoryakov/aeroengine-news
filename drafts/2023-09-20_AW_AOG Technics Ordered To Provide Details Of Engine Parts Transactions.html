            AOG Technics Ordered To Provide Details Of Engine Parts Transactions

            AOG Technics, the UK-based broker accused of selling thousands of
            engine parts with falsified paperwork, has been ordered to turn over
            records of its GE Aerospace-related transactions, a London court
            ordered. The London High Court ruling, issued during a Sept. 20
            hearing gives the company 14 days to hand over details on any CFM56
            and CF6 parts it acquired and sold, along with relevant supporting
            documentation. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed Sept.
            7 by CFM and its co-owners, GE Aerospace and Safran against AOG
            Technics and founder Jose Zamora Yrala. A summary of the
            manufacturer’s argument before the court confirms that falsified
            airworthiness approval tags and other relevant records have been
            linked to thousands of parts sold by AOG Technics. The probe has
            turned up 86 examples of forged documents, some covering many parts.
            In one case, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)
            turned over one of its AAC-038 approval tags, later confirmed as
            fake, that came with 32 overhauled CFM56 high pressure compressor
            (HPC) stage 1 vanes. Two fake FAA 8130-3s covering hundreds of GE
            CF6 parts were found, the summary said. More than 80 EASA Form 1s
            representing thousands of CFM56 parts, including turbine blades and
            seals, have been flagged and confirmed as forgeries. In all cases,
            the fake documentation was made to look like it came from CFM or one
            of its owners. So far, no life-limited parts have been flagged in
            the probe. AOG Technics parts have been found on 96 engines so far—a
            figure that is likely to grow given the number of parts confirmed to
            have fake records. Gaining insight on AOG Technics’ transactions
            will help the industry quantify the scope and risk of its scheme.
            Knowing who it sold parts to will aid CFM, operators, maintenance
            providers and regulators in their effort to confirm whether they are
            airworthy and isolate any questionable parts. Learning where AOG
            Technics got the material is just as critical, as it will help
            quantify the hazard level the parts present. “We applaud the court’s
            ruling compelling AOG Technics to release documentation that will
            aid the industry in more rapidly identifying parts sold with
            fraudulent documentation so they can be promptly addressed,” CFM
            said in a statement. “Safety is our first priority, and we are
            taking aggressive legal action against AOG Technics for selling
            unapproved aircraft engine parts with falsified airworthiness
            documentation. We remain united with the aviation community in
            working to keep unapproved parts out of the global supply chain.”
            Several airlines have confirmed having AOG Technics parts on their
            engines, including Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and Virgin
            Australia. Bloomberg was first to report the airlines involved. CFM
            and its co-owners, GE Aerospace and Safran, have been working with
            industry since June to flag parts sold by AOG Technics with
            falsified records, the court briefing revealed. TAP Maintenance and
            Engineering flagged EASA Form 1s linked to “certain” CFM56 parts and
            allegedly generated by CFM. The engine manufacturer confirmed the
            records were false, highlighting fake purchase-order numbers and an
            unknown signature. TAP then turned over 24 more Form 1s shipped with
            CFM56 parts bought by AOG Technics and allegedly generated by the
            manufacturer. These were forged as well, CFM concluded. The findings
            prompted CFM to alert industry and regulators, kicking off a global
            records review to find parts sold by AOG Technics and either pull
            them from service or remove them from spare parts supplies if
            related documentation was determined to be fake. An early August
            European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) bulletin urged
            operators and repair stations to review their records, flag any
            parts in their possession that passed through AOG Technics, and
            verify whether airworthiness approval tags were generated by the
            companies listed on them. Parts with falsified records should be
            quarantined, EASA said. EASA later confirmed the discovery of many
            forged documents. The UK Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) issued
            a similar bulletin, noting that “some” AOG Technics parts were
            installed on UK-registered aircraft. The FAA confirmed it is working
            with its European counterparts on the issue. “The FAA is
            investigating the issue and is coordinating closely with the
            European Aviation Safety Agency and the UK Civil Aviation
            Authority,” the agency said. “The FAA takes suspected unapproved
            parts cases very seriously and takes action as necessary for
            safety.” Sean Broderick Senior Air Transport & Safety Editor Sean
