        <p>FAA Finalizes Boeing 737NG Nacelle Retrofit Schedule</p>
        <p>Sean Broderick</p>

        <p>
            The FAA has signed off on Boeing’s proposed 737 Next Generation
            nacelle retrofit program, setting an August 2028 deadline for
            operators to complete the modifications, and giving the company
            until the end of 2029 to deliver maintenance error mitigation plans
            linked to the new designs. Under Boeing’s plan, it will finalize
            service bulletins detailing the modification work by the end of
            2024. Operators will then have until July 31, 2028, or another 43
            months, to retrofit their fleets. The FAA formalized the plan via an
            exemption granted to Boeing earlier in September. The step was
            needed so Boeing can roll out the changes incrementally, instead of
            getting the entire redesign approved as a system before retrofits
            begin. This gets the individual modifications into the fleet more
            quickly. Boeing’s redesign focuses on three main areas: new inlet
            spacers and fasteners, a fan cowl support beam, and a stiffer
            exhaust nozzle. The combination is meant to make nacelles less
            susceptible to breaking apart if a fan blade fails. Boeing agreed to
            make the changes following two CFM56-7B engine failures involving
            Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700s, including one in April 2018 with
            a passenger fatality. Boeing filed its initial exemption request in
            July 2021. The company asked for seven years to develop the
            modifications and get them into the fleet. The FAA exemption adopts
            this schedule, with one notable change. Boeing has until the end of
            2029 to deliver “solutions to address potential maintenance errors,”
            such as ensuring fan cowl doors are always secured before flight.
            Regulators around the world are likely to mandate the retrofits as
            well, setting the stage for as many as 6,500 aircraft to undergo
            modifications. The Aviation Week Network Fleet Discovery database
            shows 6,300 737NGs of all types in service and another 230 in
            storage. Boeing asked for the extra time earlier in 2023, citing an
            FAA “policy letter” sent in response to a company query. The letter,
            which has not been made public, relates to new system safety
            assessment (SSA) requirements the FAA is introducing. Among the
            myriad changes is reclassifying some human factors-related failure
            modes as unsafe system operating conditions that must be
            addressed—and mitigated—by manufacturers. An unlatched fan cowl door
            is one example. The exemption also gives Boeing an additional 17
            months, or until the end of 2024, to ensure its proposed designs can
            comply with the new SSA requirements before finalizing them and the
            related modification instructions. “Boeing’s requested extension of
            the exemption maintains the level of safety of the existing
            exemption by ensuring operators will have service instructions
            available to begin implementing design changes without change to the
            original schedule,” the FAA said in granting the exemption. “The
            revised exemption will allow both Boeing and operators more time to
            address appropriate solutions to potential maintenance errors,
            further improving the level of safety of the airplane.” Sean
