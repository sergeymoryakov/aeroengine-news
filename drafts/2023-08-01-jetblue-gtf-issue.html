                JetBlue Airways expects more of its Airbus narrowbodies to be
                grounded by the latest Pratt &amp; Whitney geared turbofan (GTF)
                issue as the dismantling of its alliance with American Airlines
                and shifting demand patterns have forced the airline to slash
                its earnings forecast for 2023.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                In July, Pratt said it was revamping inspection protocols on
                certain PW1100G GTFs, stating roughly 200 engines would be
                removed for enhanced inspection.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p style="">
                Prior to the latest development, many airlines using the engines
                were battling durability issues and premature engine removals.
                During an Aug. 1 earnings discussion, JetBlue CFO Ursula Hurley
                said the airline had two A321neos on the ground for the last
                couple of months “due to various engine issues.”&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                “We have been notified by Pratt &amp; Whitney over the last few
                weeks that we have a handful of engines that will be impacted
                and have to come off wing by mid-September,” Hurley said. “We
                expect the number of aircraft that we have on the ground through
                the end of the year to approximately double from what we have
                today.”
            </p>

            <p>
                JetBlue president Joanna Geraghty said the company is attempting
                to take whatever self-help measures are available “to obtain
                additional engines on the leasing market, but as you know that
                supply is pretty constrained at this point.”
            </p>

            <p>
                The airline is still working through any potential impact on the
                GTF engines powering its A220 fleet, Hurley noted.
            </p>

            <p>
                New York-based JetBlue took delivery of four aircraft in the
                second quarter (Q2), bringing total deliveries for 2023 to
                seven. Hurley said the airline expects to take delivery of 12
                additional aircraft through year-end. At the end of Q2, JetBlue
                had a fleet of 291 aircraft.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hurley said that no impact from the additional grounded aircraft
                was included in JetBlue’s updated financial guidance. The
                airline has slashed its earnings per share projections for
                2023—from $0.70 to $1.00 previously down to a range of $0.05 to
                $0.40.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                Roughly $0.20-$0.25 of the impact stems from the wind down of
                JetBlue’s Northeast Alliance (NEA) with American after a judge
                found the partnership to be anticompetitive in May of 2023 and
                ordered the carriers to end the arrangement. American has said
                it will appeal the decision while JetBlue said it is terminating
                the NEA to focus on its merger with Spirit Airlines, which is
                subject to litigation by the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ). The
                DOJ was also the plaintiff in the lawsuit to dismantle the
                NEA.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                “Our decision to terminate the NEA will result in near-term drag
                on margins as we lose key codeshare revenue,” JetBlue CEO Robin
                Hayes said.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                Another $0.20 to $0.25 of the EPS reduction is attributed to
                weather disruptions and air traffic control challenges in the
                U.S. Northeast in summer 2023. The remaining $0.15 to $0.20 cut
                to the earnings per share guidance is a shift in demand to
                long-haul markets.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                JetBlue noted it was “reallocating capacity from underperforming
                NEA routes to higher value leisure opportunities,” with
                improvement starting in the first quarter of 2024.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                Offering a bit of insight into the wind down of the NEA, JetBlue
                Head of Revenue and Planning Dave Clark said the airline has
                already made some initial adjustments in Boston, “where we don’t
                have to work through slot issues and constraints.”&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                Prior to the NEA’s launch, JetBlue operated 16 daily round trips
                from New York LaGuardia, Clark said. Under the alliance, that
                number grew to 52.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                “As we go into the winter season, you’ll see a step-down by
                about a handful of flights in LaGuardia,” Clark said. Starting
                in mid-spring for the 2024 summer season, “you’ll see us flying
                less than half of those 36 growth round trips ... so it will be
                an orderly wind down.” Under the NEA, JetBlue was also leasing
                slots at New York JFK from JetBlue; the total number of slots it
                has on lease from American at both New York airports is roughly
                100.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <p>
                Although JetBlue has made significant cuts to its 2023 earnings
                outlook, its operating revenue in Q2 grew 6.7% year-on-year to
                $2.6 billion as operating expenses fell 7.2% to $2.4 billion.
                Its net income was $138 million versus a loss of $188 million
                the year prior.&nbsp;<br />
